# AdvanceCoreConcepts

This project is an ASP.NET Core API developed from scratch, focusing on Employee CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It's built with flexibility, performance, and robustness in mind.

## Functionalities:

#### 1) Logging Middleware:
The API integrates a custom Logging Middleware to capture detailed information on every incoming request, outgoing response, and any encountered errors. This ensures comprehensive tracking of API interactions. Furthermore, Serilog UI is incorporated to offer a user-friendly interface for real-time log visualization. The Serilog UI can be accessed via http://localhost:5173/serilog-ui.

#### 2) Generic Constraints:
Leveraging the Generic Repository pattern, the project implements a flexible and reusable data access layer. By abstracting common data access operations, the Generic Repository promotes cleaner code architecture and facilitates easier maintenance and extension of the application.

#### 3) Caching:
To enhance performance and minimize database load, the API utilizes Redis cache. By caching frequently accessed data, Redis optimizes response times and improves overall system efficiency. This caching mechanism contributes to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

#### 4) API Versioning:
API versioning is implemented to manage changes and updates in a controlled manner. Specifically, version 2 of the GetEmployeeById method is introduced, ensuring backward compatibility while allowing for the introduction of new features and improvements. This versioning strategy ensures seamless integration with existing client applications while facilitating future enhancements.

#### 5) Request Pipeline:
The ASP.NET Core Request Pipeline is carefully configured to efficiently handle incoming requests. It encompasses various middleware components, including the Logging Middleware mentioned earlier, which intercept, process, and generate responses for each request. Through this meticulously designed pipeline, the API ensures optimal performance, security, and extensibility.
